# HPC - PageRank algorithm

## HPC - PageRank algorithm

Here you will find the improved pageRank algorithm in c.

The "files_management.*" files are mainly intended for reading the file (in which we have the graph).

The "matrix_calculation.*" files are intended for calculations and processing related to the pageRank algorithm.

The "main.c" file is the implementation of the pageRank algorithm.

The "matrix.txt" file representing the links between the nodes must be in this form:

the first line represents the number of nodes in the graph. Then, for each line, we have the links for each node (0 means no link).

## Launch of the program
